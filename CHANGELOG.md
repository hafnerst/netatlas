# Changelog

All notable changes to NetAtlas are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). While the version is 0.x, minor
releases may still change behaviour.

Two version numbers are involved. The **application version** (0.1.1) names
a NetAtlas release and is shown next to the logo. The **model format
version** (`netatlas: 1`) names the YAML format a model file is written in;
it is described in [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-30

NetAtlas 0.1.1 is still one self-contained, offline HTML file
(`dist/netatlas.html`). It reads and writes YAML model format 1.

### YAML model format 1

Model format 1 ([docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md)) is the only model format
NetAtlas supports. Every file starts with `netatlas: 1`.

* **Strict validation.** A missing `netatlas:` line, any other value, an
  unknown key and the keys listed under
  [Rejected keys and values](docs/FORMAT.md#rejected-keys-and-values) are
  errors, located at the key, each saying what to write instead. Nothing is
  converted, guessed or accepted as an alias. A file with errors opens as a
  draft, keeps everything it contains, and is downloaded only after an
  explicit **Download anyway**.
* **Configure once, derive elsewhere.** Each fact has one place in the file;
  everything that follows from it is shown read-only (marked *derived*) and
  never written back:
  * a network is its `cidr` prefixes (each with a prefix length) and an
    optional `vlan` (1–4094); its **members are derived** from the interface
    and loopback addresses inside a prefix;
  * the **VLAN of an interface address** is derived from the network that
    contains it; networks with different VLANs give an explicit *ambiguous*
    and a warning;
  * `speed` and `medium` are configured on the **link** only;
  * each **link end** lists the VLANs it permits (`vlans`): several are a
    *Trunk*, one is *VLAN n*, none is *No VLAN*; different lists at the two
    ends give a warning and ⚠ on the cable;
  * `vrf` is set on interfaces and loopbacks.
* **Two categories of interfaces.** A device has `interfaces` (physical
  ports, without a type) and `logical_interfaces` (`type: loopback`,
  `virtual` or `tunnel`), with one set of ids per device. Only a physical
  interface can be cabled. An aggregate lists its `members`; a VLAN
  interface names its `vlan`, and the ports carrying it are derived from the
  link ends; a tunnel names its `source` and `destination`.
* **Devices** have `id`, `label`, `type` (one of 15), `group`, `tier`,
  `description`, `attrs` and the two interface lists. Other facts go in
  `attrs`.
* **Groups:** `kind` is free text; `floor` is the kind for a storey.

### Editor

* **Start screen** with three ways to begin: **New model**, **Open YAML
  file…** (also a drop target; a file dropped anywhere on the page is
  opened) and **Load example** (a picker with the six examples). A file that
  can't be opened is reported with the reason and a way back.
* **File menu:** **New model**, **Open model…**, **Download model…**
  (Ctrl+S), **Close model** and **Examples**. *Close model* asks first when
  there are unsaved changes: **Download and close**, **Discard changes** or
  **Cancel**.
* **Interfaces** are edited in two sections, *Physical interfaces* and
  *Logical interfaces*, with **+ Interface**, **+ Port Range**,
  **+ Loopback**, **+ Virtual** and **+ Tunnel**. **+ Port Range** creates
  a numbered range of ports (`ge 1/1` … `ge 1/24`) in one undoable step,
  with a preview; invalid ranges are rejected as a whole with the reason.
* Interfaces are listed alphabetically (digits by value) in the editor,
  the details and the pickers; the order in the file is not changed.
* VLAN pickers per link end; derived values are marked *derived* and can't
  be edited.
* The model outline's sections fold (*Collapse all* / *Expand all*); a
  folded section still shows its count, problems and related entries.
* The model's title and description are edited with **Edit model
  settings** in the Edit tab. The model panel is always visible and adapts
  to narrow windows.

### Diagrams and Auto-arrange

* **Sized for their text.** Labels wrap and nothing is shortened with "…";
  boxes, network pills, group titles and relation labels grow to fit, and
  networks show all their prefixes.
* **Readable cabling.** Ports that face each other are lined up, cables bend
  around devices instead of crossing them, and every cable with a speed,
  VLANs or a label shows it. Cable, relation and address labels avoid nodes
  and each other.
* **Groups are placed by their cabling** in the physical view.
* **Auto-arrange works on the view on screen only.** If that view has
  positions set by hand, a confirmation names what moves; Cancel changes
  nothing. The button shows the view's layout status (✓ auto-arranged,
  ✎ manually adjusted, ● edited since arranged).
* Selecting a logical interface highlights the ports it uses and their
  cables; selecting a port highlights the logical interfaces that use it.

### Export

* **Export → Export view as… → PNG / SVG.** Both formats save the selected
  view (Physical or Logical) as the same picture: the whole diagram
  whatever the zoom, full labels, the legend and a **Networks overview**
  that lists the networks relevant to that view, with a margin. Files are
  named `<model>-<view>.png` / `.svg`. The PNG is drawn at twice the
  diagram's size (less for very large diagrams). A failed export is
  reported in a dialog and nothing is downloaded.
* The submenu opens by click, tap, Enter, Space or arrow right, never on
  hover; arrow left or Esc closes it.

### Fixed

* The application fits the browser viewport: in a window that isn't
  maximized the page no longer gets a scrollbar of its own, and the
  right-hand panel no longer extends below the status bar. Long forms and
  lists scroll inside their panels.

### Known limitations

* **YAML:** not full YAML (anchors, aliases and multi-line plain scalars
  are rejected); formatting is normalised on export, comments and key
  order are kept.
* **Saving** always downloads a new file; a web page can't overwrite the
  file it opened.
* **Auto-arrange** is heuristic: dense meshes still cross, and relation
  lines are straight.
* **Network semantics** are only partly checked; membership is by address
  only (VRFs don't separate address spaces).
* **Logical interfaces** have three kinds of association: member ports, a
  VLAN, and a tunnel's source and destination.
* **Very large diagrams** may exceed what a browser can draw as one PNG;
  the SVG export has no such limit.
* **Browsers:** diagram elements aren't individually keyboard-focusable;
  the automated browser test runs in Chromium-based browsers only; Firefox
  and Safari are covered by the manual `#selftest` check.
* See the README's "Limitations" section for details.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

First release: a usable initial version, not a complete one.

### What it does

* **One self-contained HTML file** (`dist/netatlas.html`, about 0.5 MB):
  * opens directly from disk (`file://`) in Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari;
  * no server, no network access (enforced by a Content-Security-Policy with
    `default-src 'none'`), no external assets, no third-party runtime code.
* **YAML model** (format version 1, [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md)):
  * devices with interfaces, links (physical cabling), networks and logical
    relations;
  * groups (sites, rooms, racks …) and custom protocol definitions;
  * a documented, safe YAML subset
    ([docs/YAML-SUBSET.md](docs/YAML-SUBSET.md)) with line-precise error
    messages and suggestions.
* **Physical view:**
  * devices with ports and interface names;
  * cables by medium and speed;
  * nested location boxes.
* **Logical view:**
  * networks, routing adjacencies, overlays, redundancy groups and services;
  * tunnels drawn as hollow tubes, with nesting (e.g. OSPF over GRE over
    IPsec);
  * multipoint hubs and loopback chips.
* **Loopbacks:**
  * multiple IPv4/IPv6 loopbacks per device, with strict address checks;
  * `router_id` pointing at a loopback.
* **Device types:** 15 types, each with its own icon and display name:
  * router, switch, firewall, ap, server, vm, container, storage;
  * load_balancer, proxy, ids_ips, gateway, endpoint, cloud, system.
* **Editor:**
  * create, edit, duplicate and delete every element;
  * rename ids with all references updated;
  * protocol-specific attributes as an editable tree;
  * a raw YAML tab;
  * undo/redo;
  * validation as you type, with errors shown at the field.
* **No implicit defaults:** new elements get only an id. Type, kind,
  protocol and category stay unset until you choose them.
* **Round trip:** export and reload keep comments, key order, unknown keys and
  attributes no view shows. Invalid models are only exported after an
  explicit "Download anyway".
* **Positions:**
  * drag devices and networks; positions are stored in the model's `layout:`
    section;
  * deterministic **Auto-arrange** for either or both views;
  * a per-view status: *Auto-arranged* / *Manually adjusted* / *Edited since
    arranged*.
* **Selection and navigation:**
  * selecting an element highlights related elements in the diagram and marks
    the directly related entries in the element lists;
  * search and SVG export.

### Known limitations

* **YAML:**
  * not full YAML: anchors, aliases and multi-line plain scalars are
    rejected;
  * formatting (indentation, flow spacing) is normalised on export; comments
    and key order are kept.
* **Saving** always downloads a new file; a web page can't overwrite the file
  it opened.
* **Auto-arrange** is heuristic: dense meshes still cross, and lines are
  straight, not orthogonally routed.
* **Network semantics** are only partly checked: addresses, duplicates and
  prefix membership are checked; routing and VLAN consistency are not.
* **Browsers:**
  * the element lists are hidden in windows narrower than 1100 px;
  * diagram elements aren't individually keyboard-focusable;
  * the automated browser test runs in Chromium-based browsers only; Firefox
    and Safari are covered by the manual `#selftest` check.
* See the README's "Limitations" section for details.
