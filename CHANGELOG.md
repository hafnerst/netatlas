# Changelog

All notable changes to NetAtlas are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). While the version is 0.x, minor
releases may still change behaviour; the YAML format has its own version
(`netatlas: 1`) and stays readable across application versions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

First release: a usable initial version, not a complete one.

### What it does

* **One self-contained HTML file** (`dist/netatlas.html`, about 0.5 MB):
  * opens directly from disk (`file://`) in Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari;
  * no server, no network access (enforced by a Content-Security-Policy with
    `default-src 'none'`), no external assets, no third-party runtime code.
* **YAML model** (format version 1, [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md)):
  * devices with interfaces, links (physical cabling), networks and logical
    relations;
  * groups (sites, rooms, racks …) and custom protocol definitions;
  * a documented, safe YAML subset
    ([docs/YAML-SUBSET.md](docs/YAML-SUBSET.md)) with line-precise error
    messages and suggestions.
* **Physical view:**
  * devices with ports and interface names;
  * cables by medium and speed;
  * nested location boxes.
* **Logical view:**
  * networks, routing adjacencies, overlays, redundancy groups and services;
  * tunnels drawn as hollow tubes, with nesting (e.g. OSPF over GRE over
    IPsec);
  * multipoint hubs and loopback chips.
* **Loopbacks:**
  * multiple IPv4/IPv6 loopbacks per device, with strict address checks;
  * `router_id` pointing at a loopback.
* **Device types:** 15 types, each with its own icon and display name:
  * router, switch, firewall, ap, server, vm, container, storage;
  * load_balancer, proxy, ids_ips, gateway, endpoint, cloud, system.
* **Editor:**
  * create, edit, duplicate and delete every element;
  * rename ids with all references updated;
  * protocol-specific attributes as an editable tree;
  * a raw YAML tab;
  * undo/redo;
  * validation as you type, with errors shown at the field.
* **No implicit defaults:** new elements get only an id. Type, kind,
  protocol and category stay unset until you choose them.
* **Round trip:** export and reload keep comments, key order, unknown keys and
  attributes no view shows. Invalid models are only exported after an
  explicit "Download anyway".
* **Positions:**
  * drag devices and networks; positions are stored in the model's `layout:`
    section;
  * deterministic **Auto-arrange** for either or both views;
  * a per-view status: *Auto-arranged* / *Manually adjusted* / *Edited since
    arranged*.
* **Selection and navigation:**
  * selecting an element highlights related elements in the diagram and marks
    the directly related entries in the element lists;
  * search and SVG export.

### Known limitations

* **YAML:**
  * not full YAML: anchors, aliases and multi-line plain scalars are
    rejected;
  * formatting (indentation, flow spacing) is normalised on export; comments
    and key order are kept.
* **Saving** always downloads a new file; a web page can't overwrite the file
  it opened.
* **Auto-arrange** is heuristic: dense meshes still cross, and lines are
  straight, not orthogonally routed.
* **Network semantics** are only partly checked: addresses, duplicates and
  prefix membership are checked; routing and VLAN consistency are not.
* **Browsers:**
  * the element lists are hidden in windows narrower than 1100 px;
  * diagram elements aren't individually keyboard-focusable;
  * the automated browser test runs in Chromium-based browsers only; Firefox
    and Safari are covered by the manual `#selftest` check.
* See the README's "Limitations" section for details.

### Compatibility

* This is the first release; there are no earlier versions to migrate from.
* **Files written during development may need one change:** `type` must be
  one of the 15 device types. Older values such as `l3switch`, `hypervisor`,
  `host`, `leaf` or `spine` are reported as errors that name the type to use.
  Spine/leaf roles belong in `role`; use `tier` to change the row.
* **Changed meaning of a missing value:** a group or network without `kind` is
  no longer treated as `site` / `subnet`; it is drawn without a kind.
* **Positions:** stored positions are never changed by an upgrade. A later
  version may arrange differently only when you press Auto-arrange again.
